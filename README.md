Files go here.
Hello there, I'm Allie. A weirdo, a nanny, a massage therapist, and basically 100% new to everything here---minus my high school obsession over HTML, which I haven't meddled with in over 10 years. I'm really none of those things. I just do those things. I'm trying to do something different, challenging perhaps, while pondering on the meaning of life.  *laughs*
